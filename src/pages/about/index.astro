    <h1>About SimpleTools</h1>

    <p>
      SimpleTools is a free calculator platform built for fast, practical decisions. The goal is simple:
      reduce guesswork by making common calculations quick, clear, and repeatable.
    </p>

    <h2>Who it’s for</h2>
    <p>
      SimpleTools is designed for people who need quick answers—especially small business operators and online sellers.
      Today we focus on e-commerce workflows, and we’ll expand into other categories over time.
    </p>

    <h2>What makes it different</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No login</strong> — use tools instantly.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear explanations</strong> — each tool includes how it works, formulas, and FAQs.</li>
      <li><strong>Built to scale</strong> — categories can expand without changing the core structure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why it’s free</h2>
    <p>
      The site is supported by advertising. Keeping the tools free helps more people make better decisions without
      friction or paywalls.
