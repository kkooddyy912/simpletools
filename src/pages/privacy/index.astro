    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-18</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SimpleTools provides free calculators without requiring an account. We aim to collect as little personal data as
      possible.
    </p>

    <h2>No login</h2>
    <p>
      We do not require registration or login to use the calculators.
    </p>

    <h2>Data you provide</h2>
    <p>
      Calculator inputs are processed to show results and are not intended to identify you. We do not ask for names,
      addresses, or payment information.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies & advertising</h2>
    <p>
      We may display ads through third-party advertising partners (e.g., Google AdSense). These partners may use cookies
      or similar technologies to serve ads, measure performance, and personalize ad content as allowed by law and your
      settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      We may use basic analytics to understand overall site usage (for example, which pages are popular). If analytics
      are enabled, they are used to improve the site experience, not to identify individual users.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-party links</h2>
    <p>
      Our site may link to external websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about this policy, contact us at
